# Tic Tac Toe Tutorial with: React, TypeScript, Jest

For this project I implemented a small Tic Tac Toe game but I used the following technologies: <br />
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Jest**

## The main objectives of this example:
* Lets you play tic-tac-toe
* Indicates when a player has won the game
* Stores a game’s history as a game progresses
* Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board
* Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list
* Bold the currently selected item in the move list
* Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them
* Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order
* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win
* When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw


Addition notes and QA: <br />
I have implemented this solution many times, but what I wanted to acheive by this tutorail was <br>
taking advantage of TypeScript and TDD with TID with Jest.


What Resources did I use for the development of this project:
* [React/TypeScript READMD.md](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter
)
* [Pluralsight: Testing React Applications](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/testing-react-applications-jest/table-of-contents)


## I got the main objectives from the React tutorial site but all Implementation is my own.
