When wanting to show code coverage -> npm run test --coverage, npx jest --coverage 

Added Button component

Added History component 


Also I added new functionality to Board that needs testing

such as clicking go and traversing history. 

As well need to test resetGame() method after game ends.


Adding tests to Button component first : 
    Added snapshot test for Button.test.tsx 
    Added simulated click tests for whether function was called 
    and wether click has the added effect.


What to test for History.test.tsx : 
    Added Snapshot to <History />
